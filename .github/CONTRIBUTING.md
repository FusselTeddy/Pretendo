TODO - REDO THIS

Some starting points:

1. Don't PR to master/main
2. Always make an issue and await appoval before making PRs (unless otherwise specified)
3. Changes should have meaning and substance
4. Keep code consistent with the rest of the codebase/repos (languages, implementation patterns, style guides, etc)
